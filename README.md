### Tea Cozy

#### A project in the CodeCademy Intensive Program - Build Websites from Scratch

The instructions are to build a site from scratch to match the following mockup:

<img src="https://github.com/k-snides/tea-cozy/blob/gh-pages/img/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg" width="400" height="800" alt="The plans for the website" />

Since pixels are to be used and there is no instructions to make the website mobile friendly, this site is best viewed on a desktop.
